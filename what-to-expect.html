        <h1>What to Expect: Transitions to QRTick</h1>
        <p class="intro-text"><strong>The Hassle-Free Way to Manage Your Event.</strong><br>
            Welcome to the future of event entry. QRTick is designed to remove the logistical weight of traditional
            ticketing—eliminating the need for printing, manual distribution, and physical cash tracking. This guide
            outlines exactly what you can expect as you transition to our "digital-first" workflow.</p>

        <div class="feature-box">
            <h3>1. Pre-Event: Zero-Inventory Setup</h3>
            <p>Forget the days of counting ticket books and coordinating pickup points.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Service Agreement & Validation:</strong> To get started, we'll have you sign a simple
                    contract. Then, we ask you to review your ticketing page to ensure all details are perfect before we
                    go live.</li>
                <li><strong>Instant Digital Box Office:</strong> Once your event is live, your storefront is open 24/7.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Promotional Power:</strong> We provide a custom, high-resolution QR code that links directly
                    to your checkout page. Place this on flyers and social media to turn every promotional touchpoint
                    into an immediate sales opportunity.</li>
                <li><strong>Tiered Pricing:</strong> Easily set up Early Bird, General, or VIP tiers. The system
                    automatically manages your capacity for each.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-box">
            <h3>2. The Attendee Experience: Frictionless Delivery</h3>
            <p>We’ve removed the "Where is my ticket?" anxiety for your guests.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Immediate Access:</strong> Upon a successful checkout, the attendee’s unique QR ticket is
                    displayed immediately on their screen.</li>
                <li><strong>Email Redundancy:</strong> A copy of the ticket is also delivered directly to their email
                    inbox. They can screenshot the checkout page or pull up the email later—either way, they are ready
                    for the gate.</li>
                <li><strong>No Apps Required:</strong> By eliminating the need for a dedicated app download, you remove
                    a major barrier to purchase and gate entry. As long as guests can access their email or a
                    screenshot, they are ready for entry.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-box">
            <h3>3. Gate Management: High-Speed Entry</h3>
            <p>Your staff should be hosts, not paperwork experts.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scan-and-Go:</strong> Your staff can turn any smartphone into a secure scanner simply by
                    logging into the QRTick Organiser Dashboard. This removes the need for specialized hardware and
                    ensures a rapid, error-free entry flow.</li>
                <li><strong>Fraud Prevention:</strong> Every QR code is unique and verified in real-time. Once a ticket
                    is scanned, it is marked as "Checked In" across all staff devices, preventing duplicate entries.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Zone Control:</strong> If your event has VIP or Backstage areas, the scanner will instantly
                    notify your staff if a guest has the correct access level.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-box">
            <h3>4. Post-Event: Automated Payouts & Insights</h3>
            <p>No more staying up all night counting cash or chasing sub-sellers for "ticket money."</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Transparent Reporting:</strong> Access live sales data at any time. You’ll know exactly how
                    many tickets were sold and how many guests arrived.</li>
                <li><strong>5-Day Payout:</strong> Say goodbye to manual ledger books. Your net revenue is automatically
                    calculated and deposited directly to your bank account within 5 business days after the event.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

                <p>By default, your event is <strong>unlisted</strong>—it's live and fully functional, but only
                    accessible via your direct link or QR code. This is ideal for private events or promoters who handle
                    their own marketing.</p>
                <p>Upgrade to a <strong>listed event</strong> to get featured on the QRTick homepage, giving your event
                    prime visibility to our growing audience of ticket buyers. This premium placement can significantly
                    boost your reach and sales.</p>
                <p>Pricing varies based on factors such as <strong>seasonal demand</strong>, event duration, and feature

        <h2>Organiser FAQs</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Q: What if an attendee’s phone dies or they can't find their email?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">No problem. Your gate staff can do a quick search in the dashboard by name or email
                address to manually check them in.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Q: Can guests just screenshot a ticket and send it to friends?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">They can, but only the first person to arrive with that QR code will be granted
                entry. Any subsequent scans of that same code will be flagged as "Already Scanned."</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Q: What equipment do I need at the gate?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">No specialized hardware is required. Your team can use their own smartphones to scan
                tickets through our secure web-based organiser dashboard.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Q: How do I handle Guest Lists or "Comp" tickets?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">You can issue digital "Complimentary" tickets directly from your dashboard. These
                are emailed as QR codes just like paid tickets, ensuring your data remains accurate and entry stays
                fast.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Q: Is there a limit to how many staff members can scan tickets?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">No. You can authorize as many scanners as needed. All devices sync to the same cloud
                database in real-time to prevent any double-entries across multiple gates.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Q: Do I still have to worry about cash?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Only for "at-the-door" sales if you choose to accept them. For all online sales,
                QRTick handles the security and processing, so you don't have to carry large amounts of cash or manage
                manual ledger books.</div>
